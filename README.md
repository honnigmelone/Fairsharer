# Fair Sharer ☀️😽

## Overview 🍄

The `fairsharer` repository hosts a Python program designed for the fair distribution of values across a group.

## Functionality 🌵

The `fair_sharer` function operates by redistributing a share of the highest value in a list to its neighboring elements, over a specified number of iterations.

## Explanation 👽

values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  # Example values
num_iterations = 10  # Number of iterations
share = 0.1  # Share to be redistributed

fair_sharer(values, num_iterations, share)

## Installation

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
